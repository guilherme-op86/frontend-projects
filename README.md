These projects mark the beginning of my journey as a programmer. Each one was created during a frontend web design course, where I explored HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build functional and visually appealing websites. Through these projects, I learned essential skills such as responsive design, user experience principles, and accessibility best practices. I am passionate about creating clean, efficient code and continuously improving my development abilities. This repository serves as a reflection of my progress and a foundation for future projects that will push my skills even further.
